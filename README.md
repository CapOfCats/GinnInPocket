## 🚀 Vision

To create a **non-judgmental, always-available guide** that:
- Understands your financial reality
- Breaks down ambitious goals into achievable milestones
- Adapts to your spending habits and income
- Recommends specific, prioritized actions
- Journeys with you until the goal is reached

## 🎯 For Any Goal!

Whether you're saving for:
- 🖥️ **A custom gaming PC**
- ✈️ **A dream vacation**
- 📚 **Educational courses**
- 🏠 **A down payment**
- 🎸 **A new instrument**
- 👟 **Priority purchases** (like new underwear over new shoes!)
```

## 🔧 **How It Works (Concept)**


User Input → Financial Portrait → Goal Decomposition → Smart Recommendations → Ongoing Support

### 1. **Financial Portrait Analysis**
- Analyzes income & spending over last 3 months
- Identifies spending patterns and saving capacity
- Builds economic profile without judgment

### 2. **Goal Intelligence**
- Connects to shopping platforms for real prices
- Scrapes reviews and trends from video platforms/Reddit
- Researches alternatives and optimization strategies

### 3. **Smart Prioritization**
```
Example Decision Flow:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Goal: New Computer ($1500)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ User can save: $300/month           │
│ Timeframe: 5 months                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Recommendation:                     │
│ 1. Buy underwear NOW (priority)     │
│ 2. Save for GPU upgrade later       │
│ 3. Consider used components         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. **Continuous Companion**
- Not a one-time conversation
- Adjusts recommendations as circumstances change
- Celebrates milestones
- Suggests course corrections

```
DAY 1: "I want to build a $2000 gaming PC"
└─ Advisor: "Let's analyze your finances... 
   You can save $400/month. 
   First: buy those socks you need ($20). 
   Then: start with motherboard next month."

MONTH 3: "Unexpected car repair!"
└─ Advisor: "Adjusting plan. Delay GPU purchase, 
   focus on RAM first. Found cheaper alternative."

GOAL ACHIEVED: "PC built!"
└─ Advisor: "Congratulations! Next goal?"
